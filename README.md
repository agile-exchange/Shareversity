  **Roles & Responsibilities:** 

 The Product Owner is also accountable for effective Product Backlog management, which includes:

* Set the product vision for the team;
* Communicate with external stakeholders and translate their needs to the team;
* Creating and clearly communicating Product Backlog items;
* Ordering Product Backlog items; and,

The Scrum Master serves the Scrum Team in several ways, including:

* Facilitate daily Scrum meetings (also called “daily standups”);
* Lead sprint planning meetings;
* Conduct “retrospective” reviews to see what went well and what can be improved for the following sprint;
* Manage obstacles that arise for the team by communicating with stakeholders outside of the team;
* Coaching the team members in self-management and cross-functionality;
* Helping the Scrum Team focus on creating high-value Increments that meet the Definition of Done;
* Causing the removal of impediments to the Scrum Team’s progress; and,
* Ensuring that all Scrum events take place and are positive, productive, and kept within the timebox.

The Developers are the people in the Scrum Team that are committed to creating any aspect of a usable increment each Sprint. The specific skills needed by the Developers are often broad and will vary with the domain of work: However, the Developers are always accountable for:

* Creating a plan for the Sprint, the Sprint Backlog;
* Help in sprint planning and goal setting;
* Lend expertise to program, design, or improve products;
* Use data to find best practices for development;
* Test products and prototypes, plus other forms of quality assurance;
* Instilling quality by adhering to a Definition of Done;
* Adapting their plan each day toward the Sprint Goal; and,
* Holding each other accountable as professionals.

**Initial Product Backlog Ordering & Rationale:** 

[Initial Product Backlog](https://agile-exchange.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/AE/boards/1/backlog) (scroll to the bottom)

![backlog](https://github.com/agile-exchange/Shareversity/blob/main/images/backlog.png)

We have placed the initial items necessary to access our product at the top of the backlog (landing and log in pages), followed by increments that allow users to share their information (profiles) and research opportunities. We then move to features that allow for viewing and sorting opportunities, and adding more sharing capabilities (documents, interests, photos etc.) while also enabling email notifications to our users. Later items in the backlog include advanced privacy management once profiles are created and search capabilities based on the created profiles. Finally, we add the ability to post items other than research opportunities as a different line aimed at drawing in users, include an admin portal to manage the various lines, simplify sign on using SSO, and create the ability for users to communicate directly via direct message, all to enhance the already established user experience. 

## 3 Whole-team relative-size estimating activity

**Estimates for PBIs**:

We used planning poker to estimate PBIs. While the product owner and scrum master were present to support, only developers participated in estimating the PBIs.
