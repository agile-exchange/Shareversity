# Project: Shareversity

This is the Canvas Team 1 repository for Fall CSCI-E71

Team Name: Agile Exchange

## 1 Team Dynamics
  
  
  **Roles & Responsibilities:** 

 The Product Owner is also accountable for effective Product Backlog management, which includes:

* Developing and explicitly communicating the Product Goal;
* Set the product vision for the team;
* Communicate with external stakeholders and translate their needs to the team;
* Creating and clearly communicating Product Backlog items;
* Ordering Product Backlog items; and,
* Ensuring that the Product Backlog is transparent, visible and understood.

The Scrum Master serves the Scrum Team in several ways, including:

* Facilitate daily Scrum meetings (also called “daily standups”);
* Lead sprint planning meetings;
* Conduct “retrospective” reviews to see what went well and what can be improved for the following sprint;
* Manage obstacles that arise for the team by communicating with stakeholders outside of the team;
* Coaching the team members in self-management and cross-functionality;
* Helping the Scrum Team focus on creating high-value Increments that meet the Definition of Done;
* Causing the removal of impediments to the Scrum Team’s progress; and,
* Ensuring that all Scrum events take place and are positive, productive, and kept within the timebox.

The Developers are the people in the Scrum Team that are committed to creating any aspect of a usable increment each Sprint. The specific skills needed by the Developers are often broad and will vary with the domain of work: However, the Developers are always accountable for:

* Creating a plan for the Sprint, the Sprint Backlog;
* Help in sprint planning and goal setting;
* Lend expertise to program, design, or improve products;
* Use data to find best practices for development;
* Test products and prototypes, plus other forms of quality assurance;
* Instilling quality by adhering to a Definition of Done;
* Adapting their plan each day toward the Sprint Goal; and,
* Holding each other accountable as professionals.

**Definition of Ready:**

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LXaiHByOsPmBgDhzMa94bdU5qJQXpYsd3LIJO9vprGA/edit

Our definition of ready is inspired from the ideas of Jeff Sutherland’s guidelines:

<https://www.scruminc.com/definition-of-ready/> 

<https://scrumguides.org/> 

**Here is our definition of Ready:**

To be ready each product backlog item must have the following information:

||Criteria|Description|
| :- | :- | :- |
|1.|A short title|We have a short meaningful title which explains what we will be doing|
|2.|A well defined User story with a clear vision|<p>Each PBI has a user story that explains a software feature written from the perspective of the end user or customer that must result into a business value</p><p></p><p>Customers and project managers requirements are clearly outlined</p><p></p><p>As a < type of user >, I want < some goal > so that < some reason ></p>|
|3.|User story meets the invest principles|User Story Meets the INVEST (**Independent** (i.e. free from external dependencies and there is nothing beyond the team’s control that must be done first in order to complete the story), **Negotiable**, **Valuable**, **Estimable**, **Small** & **Testable**) criteria|
|4.|Use Cases|If there are use cases then they can be used to better describe the different action items of use story|
|5.|Understanding of the current and future behavior and significance of the User story by all team members|All the team members are on the same page and have a shared understanding of the current, future behavior of the story and its results|
|6. |Agreement on the infrastructure and development tools and design principles if any|All the members agreement on the tool and technologies  that will be used to develop the feature|
|7.|Acceptance Criteria |<p>A list of testable conditions that tell us whether we implemented the backlog item successfully</p><p></p><p><https://kasperowski.com/acceptance-criteria-template/> </p><p></p><p><https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/business/acceptance-criteria-purposes-formats-and-best-practices/> </p>|
|8.|Data Storage considerations|Are there any database related considerations for this backlog item. For example, a new table requirement for a PBI.|
|8.|Testing Plan|<p>How are we planning to test the PBI</p><p></p><p>Examples:</p><p>1. Unit test cases</p><p>2. Integration tests</p><p>3. GUI testing</p>|
|9.|Demo Script|This will tell how we will demo the PBI after its successful implementation |
|10.|Security Review|Our PBI’s must be implemented following all the security principles|
|11.|Estimate story points|Every story has an estimated story point. Estimated and sized to be completed in one sprint.|

**Definition of Done:** 

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UilKWKlqFIFUDQ2WxeH3C8XWb3C-TQSSBjK5FeHaZTw/edit

||Criteria|Description|
| :- | :- | :- |

**Real Stakeholder:**  University Administrator: Elizabeth Jackson [User Persona](https://agile-exchange.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/AGILEEXCHA/pages/458802?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiNGYwNmYxMDVkMWIzNGQ0MDgzNmNkMTg5MzA0YmM3ZjAiLCJwIjoiaiJ9)

![persona1](https://github.com/agile-exchange/Shareversity/blob/main/images/persona1.png)

**Two Additional Stakeholders:** 

Student: John Doe, 20 year old Harvard student 

Faculty: Jane Smith, 50 year old tenured Harvard professor

**Initial Product Backlog Ordering & Rationale:** 

[Initial Product Backlog](https://agile-exchange.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/AE/boards/1/backlog) (scroll to the bottom)

![backlog](https://github.com/agile-exchange/Shareversity/blob/main/images/backlog.png)

We have placed the initial items necessary to access our product at the top of the backlog (landing and log in pages), followed by increments that allow users to share their information (profiles) and research opportunities. We then move to features that allow for viewing and sorting opportunities, and adding more sharing capabilities (documents, interests, photos etc.) while also enabling email notifications to our users. Later items in the backlog include advanced privacy management once profiles are created and search capabilities based on the created profiles. Finally, we add the ability to post items other than research opportunities as a different line aimed at drawing in users, include an admin portal to manage the various lines, simplify sign on using SSO, and create the ability for users to communicate directly via direct message, all to enhance the already established user experience. 

## 3 Whole-team relative-size estimating activity

**Estimates for PBIs**:

We used planning poker to estimate PBIs. While the product owner and scrum master were present to support, only developers participated in estimating the PBIs.

### Project Part 2: First Sprint
  
Recordings / Screenshots of Scrum Activities can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jFoImuQzUL1GwPM0XBCl-rEKa0A1INnh)

**Sprint Planning**
 
  On 11/2, we conducted two Sprint planning sessions. Recording [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13kw4y9fAhlVQsMOTDn156jIUig8FHvQy/view?usp=share_link) for part 1 and [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13eYqNkZNe72fZYouQyn-UL98IFpg7nPa/view?usp=share_link) for part 2.

 Rationale for Sprint forecast: We forecast that could complete 61 story points for our first sprint. This number seemed like a reasonable estimate since the stories we chose are related to one another and because it represents roughly 1/3 of the total story points estimated for all the features to accomplish our near vision for our product in the three sprints available.
  
Only Developers participated in moving stories from the product backlog into the sprint backlog.
  
User stories were all sized correctly (less than half of total), were broken up into developer tasks, and tracked on [Kanban Board](https://agile-exchange.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/AE/boards/1). URL: https://agile-exchange.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/AE/boards/1

**Daily Scrums**
  
We conducted multiple daily scrums both in-person via Zoom and using the Sup app on Slack. Team calendar can be viewed [here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=Y19kODZhOWM0NmQxNjM2ZTBhNzQ4ODU5OTg4M2Y5MmMzMWRiYTQyNDE1YzgyYmY4ODNkZGJkNzQ5YWUxMzlhMTI0QGdyb3VwLmNhbGVuZGFyLmdvb2dsZS5jb20).
